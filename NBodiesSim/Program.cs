/*
 * NBodiesSim is a realistic Solar System simulator. Starting from initial position and velocity conditions for the Sun,
 * planets, satellites, and asteroids, it simulates—via interactions between all bodies—the behavior of each body in the
 * Solar System. This simulation uses the Raylib graphics library, though using other libraries in the future is not
 * ruled out.
 *
 * The simulation lets you select all the planets in the Solar System so you can see each planet's most notable
 * satellites as well as its rings, if it has them.
 *
 * **Pending simulator improvements**
 * - Initial usage guide, shown by pressing the F1 key
 * - Custom HUD for each planet, with information on characteristics, satellites, velocities, etc.
 * - Add the Solar System barycenter to base orbit calculations on it.
 * - Ability to load positions and velocities for a chosen date using NASA's API.
 * - Ability to save position states.
 * - Ability to generate a data cache to save time obtaining positions and velocities of each body
 * - Possible simulation of the Voyager 1 and 2 journeys.
 * - Possible visualization of the heliopause.
 * - Interaction between the different components via interfaces.
