# Guidelines (Model-Agnostic)

## Purpose
These guidelines apply to any model used in this repo. Follow them for consistency, clarity, and safe changes.

## General Behavior
- Be concise and practical.
- Ask questions only when required to proceed.
- Prefer simple, maintainable solutions.
- Avoid unnecessary changes outside the request.

## Code Changes
- Respect existing style and conventions.
- Keep changes minimal and focused.
- Add brief comments only when the logic is not obvious.
- Avoid introducing new dependencies without explicit request.

## Tools and Commands
- Prefer local search before broad scans.
- When running commands, explain why if it is not obvious.
- Do not run destructive commands unless explicitly asked.

## Outputs
- Summaries should be brief and actionable.
- Reference edited files by path.
- Suggest next steps (tests, build) when relevant.

## Assumptions and Uncertainty
- State assumptions explicitly.
- If unsure, ask a clarifying question before proceeding.
