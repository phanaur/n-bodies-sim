# N-Bodies Simulator 🌍

A realistic Solar System simulator built with C# and Raylib, featuring accurate N-body gravitational physics using the Runge-Kutta 4th order integration method.

## 📖 Overview

NBodiesSim simulates the gravitational interactions between celestial bodies in our Solar System. Starting from real initial position and velocity data, it calculates the motion of the Sun, planets, moons, and other bodies through accurate physics simulations. The simulation allows you to explore different viewpoints and observe orbital mechanics in real-time.

## ✨ Features

- **Accurate Physics**: Implementation of the Runge-Kutta 4th order (RK4) method for precise orbital mechanics
- **Real Solar System Data**: Initial conditions based on actual planetary positions and velocities
- **Multiple Camera Views**: Focus on any planet to see its satellites and rings
- **Smooth Camera Transitions**: Interpolated camera movement between different viewpoints

## 📐 Physics Implementation

### Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4)

The simulator uses RK4, a numerical integration method that provides high accuracy for solving differential equations. For each timestep, RK4 evaluates the gravitational forces at four different points:

1. **K1**: Current state (t)
2. **K2**: Midpoint using K1 slopes (t + dt/2)
3. **K3**: Midpoint using K2 slopes (t + dt/2)
4. **K4**: Endpoint using K3 slopes (t + dt)

Final position and velocity are calculated using a weighted average:

```
Δvelocity = (K1 + 2×K2 + 2×K3 + K4) × dt / 6
Δposition = (V1 + 2×V2 + 2×V3 + V4) × dt / 6
```

### Gravitational Force Calculation

Forces between all pairs of bodies are calculated using Newton's law of universal gravitation:

```
F = G × (m₁ × m₂) / r²
```

Where:
- **G** = 6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² (gravitational constant)
- **m₁, m₂** = masses of the two bodies
- **r** = distance between the bodies

The simulation uses an O(n²) all-pairs algorithm, suitable for the ~17 bodies in the Solar System.

### Frame-Rate Independence

Physics calculations run at a fixed timestep (typically 1/60 second) independent of the rendering frame rate. This is achieved using an accumulator pattern:

```
Physics updates: Fixed timestep (e.g., 86400 seconds/day ÷ n subdivisions)
Rendering: Variable framerate (monitor refresh rate)
Interpolation: Smooth rendering between physics states
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Celestial Bodies (`Data/astrosData.json`)

Defines properties for each celestial body:

```json
{
  "id": 0,
  "name": "Sol",
  "mass": 1.989e30,
  "radius": 696340000,
  "position": [0, 0],
  "velocity": [0, 0],
  "color": [255, 255, 0, 255],
  "desiredTrailTime": 2592000,
  "hasRings": false
}
```

**Properties:**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Display name
- `mass`: Mass in kilograms
- `radius`: Radius in meters
- `position`: [x, y] coordinates in meters
- `velocity`: [vx, vy] in meters/second
- `color`: [R, G, B, A] values (0-255)
- `desiredTrailTime`: Trail duration in seconds
- `hasRings`: Boolean for ring rendering
- `parentId` (optional): For moons, ID of parent planet

### Camera Configurations (`Data/astrosConfig.json`)

Defines camera behavior for each viewpoint:

```json
{
  "key": "Digit3",
  "id": 3,
  "keyName": "Earth",
  "targetDistanceScale": 2e10,
  "targetRadiusScale": 15,
  "targetTimeStep": 3600,
  "targetN": 200,
  "textAlign": 0
}
```

- `targetDistanceScale`: Zoom level (distance scale in meters)
- `targetRadiusScale`: Body size rendering scale
- `targetTimeStep`: Physics simulation timestep in seconds
- `targetN`: Number of subdivisions for RK4 (higher = more accurate)
- `textAlign`: Text alignment for UI elements

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Design Patterns

- **Dependency Injection**: Manual DI in `Program.cs` for system composition
- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between Core, Data, Models, and Systems
- **Data-Driven Configuration**: All celestial body and camera data externalized to JSON
- **Fixed Timestep Loop**: Physics decoupled from rendering framerate

### Key Components

1. **PhysicsEngineRK4**: Implements Runge-Kutta 4 integration
   - `CalcAccelerations()`: Computes gravitational forces (O(n²))
   - `CalculateK1/K2/K3/K4()`: Four RK4 evaluation stages
   - `UpdateRk4()`: Main physics update method

2. **RenderSystem**: Handles all visualization
   - Celestial bodies with clamped radii (2-40 pixels)
   - Orbital trails with alpha gradient fade
   - Off-screen indicators (triangular pointers)
   - Planetary rings (Saturn, Uranus, Neptune)
   - 10,000-star background (batch-rendered for performance)

3. **Camera**: Smooth interpolated camera movement
   - Lerp-based position and scale transitions
   - FPS-independent animation
   - Multiple preset configurations

4. **DataLoader/ConfigLoader**: JSON deserialization with validation
   - File existence checks
   - Structure validation
   - Data range validation (mass > 0, array lengths, color ranges)

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Optimizations

- **Array Reuse**: Temporary arrays (`hypotheticalPos`, `hypotheticalVel`) created once per timestep, not per K-evaluation
- **Batch Rendering**: Stars rendered using Raylib's batching system
- **Spatial Culling**: Off-screen objects skipped during rendering
- **Fixed Timestep**: Predictable physics regardless of hardware

### Precision

- **Double-precision** floating-point throughout (`double` in C#)
- Position units: meters
- Velocity units: meters/second
- Mass units: kilograms
- Time units: seconds
